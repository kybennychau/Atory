I would like to find my value through learning as a programmer. 
Also, it would be an honor for me to contribute to the programming universe.
Not to compete, but to provide the world with a little bit of change.
Just like Giddens in Taiwan.

I also would like to become a pilot and bring my girl to wherever places we
would like to be and enjoy our time with both of us.
